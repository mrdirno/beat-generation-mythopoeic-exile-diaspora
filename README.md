## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from Cass's perspective, detailing her journey to Denver and the 'rhythm of the dispossessed interior' she seeks to capture in her music.
- Create a 'story for a room' told by another resident of The Babel Inn, following Merritt's rule: something true, never told before, and not poetry.
- Write the scene of Leo's final night at The Vault in New York, the argument about 'purity and sellouts,' and Morrigan's cold gaze that exiled him.
- Detail a day in the life of Merritt, the keeper of The Babel Inn, exploring the 'languages' that come to die there and the stories he hoards.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Mythopoeic Map' generator that takes a user's location and generates a personal 'exile mythology' using Beat-style prose and symbolic anchors (like Leo's jar of mud).
- Create an interactive 'Story for a Room' web app where users can write and share micro-stories under constraints (no poetry, must be true, must captivate), with a virtual 'common room' for listening.
